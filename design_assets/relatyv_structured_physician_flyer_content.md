## Physician Feedback

### Dr. Joanne Wu, MD, MDA E-RYT, CHHC, RAC
"Focusing on helping the body heal inside and out through empowering optimal education, training, and nutrition is a transformative approach that lies in the heart and soul of Neurofunctional Pain Management."

### Dr. Johnny Ross, MD, FAAPMR
"I estimate that 85% of my patients experience greater than a 50% improvement in their pain. Many report complete resolution of their pain. RX drugs and surgery are clearly indicated in certain conditions, but in my experience are often misapplied and do not result in desired outcomes. Neurofunctional Pain Management is an effective treatment for many painful conditions with no risk of adverse side effects or outcomes."

### Dr. Christopher Williams, MD
"The provider experience has been extremely rewarding. Traditional pain management often traps patients in chronic pain and opioid dependence. Neurofunctional Pain Management offers broad applications, with consistent improvements particularly in patients with peripheral neuropathy and arthritis."

### Dr. John D. Mikuzis, D.O.
"Before RELATYV NFPM, my patients relied on medications with significant side effects and addiction risk, offering only temporary relief. Previously, patients had about a 30% chance of long-term relief. Approximately 85% of my patients now experience pain relief, many beginning within two sessions. Treating one condition often improves others as well."
