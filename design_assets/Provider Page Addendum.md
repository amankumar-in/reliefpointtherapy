This page is linked subtly from the NFPM page

This page is intended for licensed healthcare providers.

Important Note: Feel free to use this document to create the page, or refer to the documents [General Flyer \- Physicians](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_gdly2V35iiteu7fY2DC_w-w5xQOKWjv) or [Physicians Flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cOuQwMdXqZemsWSAEcz2e2hm47Dwg2lX/view?usp=sharing) to create the page. These documents are also located in the [Provider Page folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F998QWRor2V2pL3I2XPA0LnBugVq32I4?usp=sharing). If you are able to integrate the statistics from those documents, that would be great. The page can be as full and lengthy as this document, or as simple and straight to the point as the flyers. I mainly want to use this page to encourage them to build a long-term referral relationship and establish further professional credibility.

This page exists to:

1. Establish clinical credibility

2. Clarify who NFPM is appropriate for

3. Explain how referrals work

4. Make collaboration easy

This is not a marketing page — it’s a provider resource hub.

# **NFPM Provider Referral & Clinical Information**

Neurofunctional Pain Management (NFPM) offers a non-invasive, drug-free option for patients with chronic pain, mobility limitations, or nerve-related symptoms who need alternatives to medications, injections, or procedures.

Our goal is to be a trusted clinical resource and long-term partner for providers seeking additional tools to support their patients.

---

## **Who We Partner With**

### **Building Long-Term Provider Relationships**

We love building ongoing relationships with providers who want reliable, non-invasive pain management options for their patients.

We collaborate with healthcare professionals caring for patients with chronic pain, mobility limitations, or nerve-related symptoms — either as a first step to pain management, or particularly when standard approaches have not provided lasting relief.

NFPM is especially valuable for patients who have not responded well to medications, injections, or traditional physical therapy.

## **Clinical Overview of NFPM**

Neurofunctional Pain Management (NFPM) is an FDA-cleared, non-invasive neuromodulation therapy that uses high-pulse electrical currents to influence pain signaling, circulation, inflammation, and tissue recovery.

NFPM is designed to:

* Reduce peripheral and central pain signaling

* Improve microcirculation and oxygen delivery

* Support neuromuscular retraining

* Accelerate wound healing in select cases

* Improve functional mobility and quality of life

Treatments are delivered in-home by a registered nurse and follow a structured, evidence-based protocol.

---

## **Technology Used**

### **Electroanalgesia vs Conventional Modalities**

NFPM utilizes FDA-cleared electroanalgesia devices designed for neuromodulation and chronic pain conditions.

Key distinctions from traditional modalities:

* Higher pulse frequencies than standard TENS

* Deeper tissue penetration

* Designed specifically for chronic and neuropathic pain

* Not a consumer-grade or wellness device

This technology targets pain at the nervous system level, rather than masking symptoms.

*FDA Certificate available upon request.*

---

## **Clinical Evidence & Outcomes**

NFPM protocols are supported by clinical studies demonstrating improvements in:

* Pain reduction

* Functional mobility

* Circulation

* Quality of life

* Reduced reliance on medications

Outcome trends commonly include:

* Significant pain reduction for most patients

* Improved ambulation and daily function

* Enhanced wound healing in appropriate cases
