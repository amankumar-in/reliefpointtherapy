## SECTION 2: WHAT IS NFPM? (Simple \+ Clear)

**Header:**  
**What Is NFPM?**  
NFPM uses FDA-cleared electroanalgesia and neuromodulation to calm overactive pain pathways, improve circulation, reduce inflammation, and support the body’s natural healing. It is non-invasive, drug-free, and performed in your home by a registered nurse.  
NFPM is ideal for people who want long-term relief without relying on medications, injections, or repeated procedures. 

**Engineer styling:**

* Two-column option with icons, content left and icons right  
* Icon ideas: “Non-invasive,” “In-home,” “FDA-cleared,” “Nurse-led”

## SECTION 3: HOW NFPM WORKS (SIMPLE OVERVIEW)

**Header:**  
**How NFPM Works**  
NFPM uses high-pulse electrical currents to:

* Reduce pain signal activity  
* Promote circulation and oxygenation  
* Decrease inflammation  
* Relax tight or overactive muscles  
* Support tissue repair  
* **Accelerate wound healing**  
* Improve mobility

Most people begin noticing relief within the first several sessions, with deeper improvements during the full 8-week program.

**Engineer notes:**

* Use icon-based horizontal layout  
* Keep the wording bite-sized  
* Light background (\#FFFFFF)

## SECTION 2: INTRO — WHY CELLULAR ACTIVATION MATTERS

**Header:**  
Why Cellular Activation?

Your body already knows how to heal. Cellular activation works by turning on your body’s own antioxidant and repair systems, rather than adding something artificial from the outside.

These products help activate natural pathways that tell your body to:  
	•	Produce more of its own antioxidants  
	•	Reduce inflammation  
	•	Support energy and cellular health  
	•	Improve skin, joint, and tissue support over time

All of the ingredients are plant-based, completely vegan, and naturally sourced. They are designed to work with your body, not override it.

Because this process works at the cellular level, it isn’t instant. While some people notice changes sooner, the most meaningful benefits typically build over 3–6 months. That’s because cells need time to repair, renew, and function better.

The good news is you can start cellular activation right away — on its own as daily wellness support, or alongside NFPM.

Engineer notes:  
	•	Use two-column layout (text \+ image)  
	•	Image options: mitochondria illustration, subtle wellness imagery  
	•	Keep design clean, calm, and easy to read

## SECTION 3: MY STORY (Nrf2 PAGE INTRO)

**Header:**  
In Case We Haven’t Met Yet…  
**Copy:**  
Hi, I’m Genis Matel — a registered nurse and founder of Relief Point Therapy.  
Before I became a provider, I was a pain patient myself. After five knee surgeries and stage-4 arthritis, I saw how often traditional care focuses on masking pain rather than helping the body repair. Later, I worked in post-operative care, watching dozens of patients cycle through procedures and medications with limited relief.  
I became passionate about natural, science-backed solutions that genuinely help the body heal.

A turning point for me was seeing a patient experience dramatic improvement after trying Nrf2 activation — and then seeing results in my own family. That’s when I brought these products into my practice.

**Subtext:**  
 Your body already knows how to heal — sometimes it just needs the right support.

**Button:**

(Links to /about)

**Engineer notes:**

* Two-column layout: text \+ your headshot  
* Keep consistent with homepage snippet styling

## SECTION 4: HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR PATH (Decision Guide)

**Header:**  
Start Here: What’s the Right Fit for You?

If you want ONE simple daily foundation  
→ **Start with Protandim Nrf2**

If you’re over 40, feel low energy, recover slowly, or want faster, deeper results  
→ **Dual Synergizer (Nrf1 \+ Nrf2)**

**Supports both:**

* Nrf2 (cell protection & antioxidant response)  
* Nrf1 (mitochondrial function & cellular energy)

*As we age, mitochondrial function naturally declines, which can affect energy and recovery. Dual Synergizer helps support this at the cellular level.*

If you want skin, hair, joint, or collagen support:  
→ **GlowStack**

Most popular options:  
✔ Protandim Nrf2  
✔ GlowStack

**Engineer notes:**

* Use 3–4 equal-width cards  
* Each card should include an icon+title+CTA linking to LifeVantage  
* Use soft background \#F6FAFA

## SECTION 5: PRODUCT CARDS

Each product must be placed in a **card** with **3 accordions**:

* What It Is  
* Best For  
* How to Save

All CTAs open in a new tab for LifeVantage.

### 🟦 Product Card 1: Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer

WHAT IT IS  
Protandim Nrf2 is a nutrigenomic supplement that activates the body’s own antioxidant and detoxification pathways, rather than supplying antioxidants directly. It’s designed to support inflammation balance, cellular repair, energy, and healthy aging at the cellular level.

WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT  
Unlike traditional antioxidants, Protandim Nrf2 activates the **Nrf2 pathway**, signaling your body to produce its own protective enzymes.

**Clinical studies have shown Protandim Nrf2 can:**

* Increase **glutathione** levels by up to **300%**  
* Increase **SOD** and **catalase** activity  
* Reduce **oxidative stress** by approximately **40% in 30 days**

BEST FOR

* Chronic inflammation  
* Low energy or sluggish recovery  
* Mental fog  
* Healthy aging and longevity support  
* Daily foundational wellness  
* Pairing with collagen (glowstack) or NFPM

WHAT TO EXPECT WITH NRF2  
Some people notice subtle improvements sooner, but **meaningful and lasting cellular benefits typically develop over 3–6 months**.  
This timeline reflects normal biology — cellular turnover, mitochondrial repair, and inflammation regulation take time.  
I don’t recommend starting Nrf2 unless you’re willing to give your body that window to respond.

HOW TO SAVE

* **Subscribe & Save:** 10% off (cancel anytime)  
* **3-pack option:** Lowers cost to approximately **$50/month**  
  * *Important:* Update delivery to **every 3 months** if ordering for one individual  
* **30-day money-back guarantee**

INGREDIENTS (Accordion)  
Protandim Nrf2 contains five plant-based, vegan-friendly ingredients:

* Turmeric root extract  
* Green tea extract  
* Bacopa monnieri  
* Milk thistle  
* Ashwagandha

While many people take these individually, **the ingredients alone do not activate the Nrf2 pathway**. The clinically studied results come from the patented synergy and ratios used in Protandim Nrf2.

## SECTION 2: YOUR STORY

**Header:**  
My Journey to Relief Point Therapy

**Body Copy (Final):**  
Hi, I’m Genis — a registered nurse, chronic pain survivor, and the founder of Relief Point Therapy.

My journey into this field began long before I ever held a nursing license. After **five knee surgeries** and stage-4 arthritis, I learned firsthand what it feels like to live with pain every single day — the fear, the frustration, the constant search for something that actually helps.

Years later, I spent several years working in **post-operative care**, and I cared for dozens of patients who were back again for their second, third, or even fourth pain procedure. They were often struggling with side effects from medications, complications from injections, or temporary relief that never lasted.

I started to ask myself:  
**Why aren’t we offering people options that help the body heal — not just cope?**

When I discovered NFPM and cellular activation, everything changed. I saw patients who had been dismissed or overlooked finally get real relief. I watched mobility return. I saw progress that felt meaningful — not just temporary.  
Most of the people who find me have “tried everything.”  
If that’s you, you are not alone — and you are not out of options.

## PART 7A — NFPM FAQ LIBRARY

Use these ONLY on:  
 [**www.reliefpointtherapy.com/nfpm**](http://www.reliefpointtherapy.com/nfpm)  
---

1\. What does NFPM feel like?  
Most people feel gentle pulses, tingling, or warmth. It should never feel sharp or painful.  
Many patients even fall asleep during treatment because it can be deeply relaxing. Some patients even choose to work at their desk during treatment.  
---

2\. How soon will I notice results?  
Some people notice improvements after a few sessions. Most begin experiencing meaningful changes during the 8-week program as mobility increases and pain decreases.  
---

3\. Is NFPM safe?  
Yes. NFPM uses FDA-cleared electroanalgesia. It’s non-invasive, drug-free, and safe for a wide range of patients.  
A provider will review your medical history to ensure there are no contraindications.  
---

4\. Is NFPM covered by insurance?  
Yes — NFPM is covered by Medicare and many PPO insurance plans.  
Cash-pay options are also available.  
---

5\. Can I continue my current treatments?  
Yes. NFPM can typically complement physical therapy, medications, or other treatments. Your provider will coordinate care safely.  
---

6\. How long do appointments take?  
Each NFPM session lasts up to 60 minutes (a little longer if receiving IV therapy).  
You’ll receive two treatments per week for 8 weeks — 16 sessions total.  
If opting for IV hydration (recommended for most patients), every other session will include IV hydration.  
---

7\. Do I need a referral?  
Before starting treatment, we will verify your insurance benefits to confirm whether a referral is required for coverage.  
If your plan does require one, **we will walk you step-by-step** through how to request it from your provider.  
We also work with partner providers who may be able to issue a referral after a telehealth consultation, when appropriate.  
---

8\. What conditions does NFPM help?  
NFPM commonly helps:

* Knee pain  
* Back pain  
* Neuropathy  
* Sciatica  
* Arthritis  
* Muscle tightness  
* Post-surgical pain  
* Slow-healing wounds  
   …and more.

If you don’t see your condition listed, feel free to message me to see if NFPM may help.  
---

9\. What should I expect after a session?  
Most patients feel relaxed afterward. Some may experience temporary soreness or increased circulation.  
Hydration and light movement are encouraged to support recovery.  
---

10\. How long do results last?  
Results vary and can last **three months to over a year**. Many patients experience sustained improvement due to reduced inflammation, improved circulation, and neuromuscular retraining.  
Maintenance may include movement, hydration, and/or cellular support.  
---

11\. Why haven’t I heard of NFPM before?  
NFPM has been around for many years, but several factors kept it from becoming widely known:

**1\. It doesn’t involve surgeries or prescriptions.**  
Because NFPM is non-invasive and drug-free, it doesn’t fall into the traditional “procedure-first” model used by many pain clinics.

**2\. Twice-weekly clinic visits used to make it hard to access.**  
Before in-home care became available, many patients with chronic pain or mobility issues struggled to attend treatments consistently.

**3\. NFPM focuses on healing, not temporary symptom-masking.**  
Treatments that don’t involve procedures or ongoing prescriptions often receive less mainstream attention.

**4\. Most patients don’t learn about NFPM until they’ve tried everything else.**  
Many of my patients discover NFPM only after years of injections, medications, PT, and procedures that didn’t bring lasting relief.  
As in-home NFPM expands, more people are finally getting access to this evidence-based, FDA-cleared option.

## PART 7B \- NRF2 FAQ

Nrf2 / Cellular Activation FAQ Library  
Use these ONLY on:  
 [**www.reliefpointtherapy.com/nrf2**](http://www.reliefpointtherapy.com/nrf2)  
---

1\. What is Protandim Nrf2?  
Protandim Nrf2 helps your body turn on its own natural defense system. It signals your cells to make more of their own antioxidants, including glutathione. In studies, it has been shown to increase glutathione by up to 300%.

Protandim Nrf2 is also the only product on the market shown in human studies to lower oxidative stress by about 40%. 

Oxidative stress is a major driver of inflammation, stress, aging, and many chronic health issues.

It is made from a patented blend of plant-based ingredients that work together to support cellular health and repair. You can find the full ingredients list on the LifeVantage product page.  
---

2\. How long does it take to see results?  
Most people begin noticing benefits in **6–8 weeks**, though some feel improvements sooner.  
Cellular repair naturally takes 60–90 days, but we encourage committing to Nrf2 for at least 3–6 months for a fair evaluation.  
I generally don’t recommend starting Nrf2 unless you’re willing to give your cells enough time to respond.  
---

3\. What is GlowStack?  
GlowStack combines Nrf2 with liquid collagen and peptides to support skin elasticity, joint comfort, hydration, bone density, and recovery. Visible results often begin around **6–8 weeks**.  
---

4\. Which product should I start with?  
If choosing only one → **Protandim Nrf2**  
For 40+, energy, deeper or faster results → **Dual Synergizer**  
For skin, hair, joint, and collagen support → **GlowStack**  
---

5\. Can I take these with my current supplements?  
Yes — these are nutrigenomic, plant-based products designed to support your body’s natural cellular pathways. They are generally very well tolerated, and most people do not experience side effects.

If you have specific concerns, feel free to discuss them with your healthcare provider. All ingredients are plant-based and vegan.  
---

6\. Are these treatments covered by insurance?  
No — cellular activation products are wellness supplements and are not insurance-covered.  
---

7\. Is there a money-back guarantee?  
Yes — all LifeVantage orders include a **30-day money-back guarantee**.  
---

8\. Can I use these with NFPM?  
Yes. Many patients use cellular activation to support inflammation reduction, energy, recovery, and overall wellness alongside their NFPM program for faster, deeper results.  
---

9\. How do subscriptions work?  
Subscribe & Save gives 10% off and can be canceled anytime.  
---

10\. What if I’m still not sure what I need?  
You can submit your information on the products page, and I will personally build a recommendation and a direct checkout link for you.

11\. What are the ingredients in Protandim Nrf2, and why can’t I just take them separately?  
Protandim Nrf2 is made from five plant-based, vegan-friendly ingredients:

* Turmeric root extract  
* Green tea extract  
* Bacopa monnieri  
* Milk thistle  
* Ashwagandha

While many people take these herbs individually, **the ingredients alone do not activate the Nrf2 pathway**.

What makes Protandim unique is its **patented formula and ingredient synergy**, which clinical studies show can:

* Increase glutathione up to 300%  
* Increase SOD and catalase  
* Reduce oxidative stress by \~40% in 30 days  
* Support detoxification and cellular repair

These outcomes **cannot be replicated** by taking the ingredients separately.

# \*\*\*\* LEAD MAGNET \- EMAILS

Lead Magnet \+ Email Automation (Simple, Scalable, Low Maintenance)

This section outlines **exactly what engineers need to build now**, what is **placeholder**, and what will be **added later without rebuilding anything**.

## SECTION 10.1: LEAD MAGNET STRATEGY (OVERVIEW)

**Primary goal:**

 Capture emails from:

* People curious about pain relief  
* People not ready for NFPM  
* People who want to “start naturally”  
* People who need time before committing

This lead magnet is **educational**, **non-salesy**, and positions Genis as a trusted nurse-guide.
